        with local laws);

        We may use your personal data for the above purposes if we deem it

      <h3 className="text-md py-4 uppercase text-ic8">Marketing Activities</h3>
      <p>
        We&#39;ve listed below various ways in which we may use and process your
        personal data for marketing activities. Please note that this list is
        not exhaustive.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li className="list-disc p-2">
          enable us to develop and market other products and services;
        </li>
        <li className="list-disc p-2">
          market our full range of recruitment services to you;
        </li>
        <li className="list-disc p-2">
          send you details of reports, promotions, offers, networking and client
          events, and general information about the industry sectors which we
          think might be of interest to you;
        </li>
        <li className="list-disc p-2">
          display promotional excerpts from your details on our Site as a
          success story (only where we have obtained your express consent to do
          so); and
        </li>
        <li className="list-disc p-2">
          provide you with information about certain discounts and offers that
          you are eligible for by virtue of your relationship with IC8.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We need your consent for some aspects of these activities which are not
        covered by our legitimate interests and, depending on the situation,
        we&#39;ll ask for this via an opt-in or soft-opt-in.
        <br />
        <br />
        Soft opt-in consent is a specific type of consent which applies where
        you have previously engaged with us (for example by submitting a job
        application or CV, or registering a vacancy to be filled), and we are
        marketing other recruitment-related services. Under ‘soft opt-in’
        consent, we will take your consent as given unless or until you opt out.
        For most people, this is beneficial as it allows us to suggest other
        jobs to you alongside the specific one you applied for, significantly
        increasing the likelihood of us finding you a new position. For other
        types of e-marketing, we are required to obtain your explicit consent.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are not happy about our approach to marketing activities, you
        have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, we want to
        let you know that even if you have opted out from our marketing
        communications, it is possible that your details may be recaptured
        through public sources in an unconnected marketing campaign. We will try
        to make sure this doesn&#39;t happen, but if it does, we&#39;re sorry.
        We&#39;d just ask that in those circumstances you opt out again.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-md py-4 uppercase text-ic8">
        Equal Opportunities Monitoring (and other sensitive personal data)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Some of the data we may collect about you comes under the umbrella of
        &quot;diversity information&quot;. This could be information about your
        ethnic background, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, religion
        or other similar beliefs, and/or social-economic background. Where
        appropriate and in accordance with local laws and requirements,
        we&#39;ll use this information on an anonymised basis to monitor our
        compliance with our equal opportunities policy. We may also disclose
        this anonymised data to Clients where this is contractually required, or
        the Client specifically requests such information to enable them to
        comply with their own employment processes.
        <br />
        <br />
        This diversity information is what is called ‘sensitive’ personal
        information and slightly stricter data protection rules apply to it. We
        therefore need to obtain your explicit consent before we can use it.
        We&#39;ll ask for your consent by offering you an opt-in. This means
        that you have to explicitly and clearly tell us that you agree to us
        collecting and using this information.
        <br />
        <br />
        We may collect other sensitive personal data about you, such as
        health-related information, religious affiliation, or details of any
        criminal convictions if this is appropriate in accordance with local
        laws and is required for a role that you are interested in applying for.
        We will never do this without your explicit consent.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are not happy about our approach to processing diversity
        information and other sensitive personal data, you have the right to
        withdraw your consent at any time.

        F. How Do We Safeguard Your Data?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We are committed to taking all reasonable and appropriate steps to
        protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, or
        unauthorised access. We do this by having in place a range of
        appropriate technical and organisational measures. These include
        measures to deal with any suspected data breach.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some or all of your data may be stored outside of the European Economic
        Area (“EEA”) (The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway,
        Iceland, and Liechtenstein). You are deemed to accept and agree to this
        by using Our Site and submitting information to Us. If We do store data
        outside the EEA, We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your
        data is treated as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and
        under the GDPR.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you suspect any misuse or loss of or unauthorised access to your
        personal information, please let us know immediately.
      </p>
      <h2 className="py-4 text-lg uppercase text-ic8">
        G. How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Data For?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We only keep your personal data for as long as We need to in order to
        use it as described above and/or for as long as We have your permission
        to keep it.
        <br />
        <br />
        We will Delete your personal data from our systems if we have not had
        any meaningful contact with you (or, where appropriate, the company you
        are working for or with) for two years (or for such longer period as we
        believe in good faith that the law or relevant regulators require us to
        preserve your data).
        <br />
        <br />
        After this period, it is likely your data will no longer be relevant for
        the purposes for which it was collected.
        <br />
        <br />
        For those Candidates whose services are provided via a third-party
        company or other entity, &quot;meaningful contact&quot; with you means
        meaningful contact with the company or entity which supplies your
        services. Where we are notified by such company or entity that it no
        longer has that relationship with you, we will retain your data for no
        longer than two years from that point or, if later, for the period of
        two years from the point we subsequently have meaningful contact
        directly with you.
        <br />
        <br />
        When we refer to &quot;meaningful contact&quot;, we mean, for example,
        communication between us (either verbal or written), or where you are
        actively engaging with our online services. If you are a Candidate we
        will consider there to be meaningful contact with you if you submit your
        updated CV onto our website or take part in any of our online training.
        <br />
        <br />
        We will also consider it meaningful contact if you communicate with us
        about potential roles, either by verbal or written communication or
        click through from any of our marketing communications. Your receipt,
        opening or reading of an email or other digital message from us will not
        count as meaningful contact – this will only occur in cases where you
        click-through or reply directly.
      </p>
      <h2 className="py-4 text-lg uppercase text-ic8">
        H. Do We Share Your Data?

        <br />
        If IC8 merges with or is acquired by another business or company in the
        future, (or is in meaningful discussions about such a possibility) we
        may share your personal data with the (prospective) new owners of the
        business or company;
        <br />
        <br />
        In the case of Candidates: potential employers and other recruitment
        agencies/organisations to increase your chances of finding employment;
        <br />
        <br />
        In the case of Candidates: third parties who we have retained to provide
        services such as reference, qualification and criminal convictions
        checks;
        <br />
        <br />
        In the case of Candidates: third party partners, job boards and job
        aggregators where we consider this will improve the chances of finding
        you the right job;
        <br />
        <br />
        Individuals and organisations who hold information related to your
        reference or application to work with us, such as current, past or
        prospective employers, educators and examining bodies and employment and
        recruitment agencies;

        <br />
        Marketing technology platforms and suppliers;
        <br />
        <br />
        Tax, audit, or other authorities, when we believe in good faith that the
        law or other regulation requires us to share this data (for example,
        because of a request by a tax authority or in connection with any
        anticipated litigation);
        <br />
        <br />
        Third party outsourced IT and document storage providers where we have
        an appropriate processing agreement (or similar protections) in place;
        <br />
        <br />
        Third party service providers who perform functions on our behalf
        (including external consultants, business associates and professional
        advisers such as lawyers, auditors and accountants, technical support
        functions and IT consultants carrying out testing and development work
        on our business technology systems).
